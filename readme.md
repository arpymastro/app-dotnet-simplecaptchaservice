You should get as a result the value 3.0.100 or above. If don't, you should [download .NET Core 3.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.0) and install it on your machine.

If you are going to use Visual Studio, be aware that you need to use [Visual Studio 2019 16.3](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/dot-net-core-support-in-visual-studio-2019-version-16-3/) or [Visual Studio for Mac 8.3](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/visual-studio-2019-for-mac-version-8-3/) or above.
